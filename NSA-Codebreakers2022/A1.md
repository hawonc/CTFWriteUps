# Task A1 - Initial access - (Log analysis)

> We believe that the attacker may have gained access to the victim's network by phishing a legitimate users credentials and connecting over the company's VPN. The FBI has obtained a copy of the company's VPN server log for the week in which the attack took place. Do any of the user accounts show unusual behavior which might indicate their credentials have been compromised?


With this, we are also given a file called [vpn1.log](https://nsa-codebreaker.org/files/taska1/vpn.log?1671775532), giving us a log file with 171 events and information related to each attempt to access the VPN.


The task gave no clear explanation on what to find other than "signs of a possible compromise", meaning that our challenge was to 

1. Find what could make a log file seem suspicious
2. Find examples of those suspicious users


Since in the file we are given information like Username, Start Time, Duration, IP, Total Bytes, and Errors, we can start looking for a few suspicious events.


I opened the .log file as a .csv file, giving us an easily readable format with each column aligning with each data type.


From there, I tried some terminal commands to try to find the failed login attempts. To do that, I used the command 
`cat vpn.log | grep invalid | awk -F[\,\,] '{print $2}'`

However, this did not produce too many useful results, showing no signs of an intrusion, since no user had repeated authentication failures or closely placed ones. 

Next, I looked at the times, using the command `sed -e 's!EDT!!' times.txt`, and the login times I saw were not out of the ordinary. 7AM-7PM seemed to be the limit of the logins, so there were no suspicious login times.


Finally, I decided to check how long everyone was logged in. I decided that this could be much easily done through Google Sheets, and found that `Donald.Y` had a concurrent session which shows the account had 2 sessions logged in at the same time, which could be considered a suspicious event.
