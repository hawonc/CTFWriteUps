# Task B2 - Getting Deeper

It looks like the backend site you discovered has some security features to prevent you from snooping. They must have hidden the login page away somewhere hard to guess.

Analyze the backend site, and find the URL to the login page.

Hint: this group seems a bit sloppy. They might be exposing more than they intend to.

Warning: Forced-browsing tools, such as DirBuster, are unlikely to be very helpful for this challenge, and may get your IP address automatically blocked by AWS as a DDoS-prevention measure. Codebreaker has no control over this blocking, so we suggest not attempting to use these techniques.


The no dirbusting rule pretty much tells us there's a login page that isnt simply /login, and we have to look for clues within the website to find how to get there.

Searching around on the website, we take a look at network traffic again to find a a x-git-commit-hash header in the response.

Checking a /git and a /.git directory, we find that the /.git directory actually exists, just not allowed to list the directory.

We install gittools, and use the ./Dumper/gitdumper.sh https://xsafjadfhngjqmit.ransommethis.net/.git/ git_dump command to dump out the files.

Looking at the app.py script, we see the login link and can access it.
