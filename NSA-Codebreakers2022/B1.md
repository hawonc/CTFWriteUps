# Task B1 - Information Gathering

The attacker left a file with a ransom demand, which points to a site where they're demanding payment to release the victim's files.

We suspect that the attacker may not have been acting entirely on their own. There may be a connection between the attacker and a larger ransomware-as-a-service ring.

Analyze the demand site, and see if you can find a connection to another ransomware-related site.


Opening the file takes us to https://joxlmnswxaxypbeq.unlockmyfiles.biz/

Simply opening up inspect element and checking the network tab gives us the domain that the website is sending get requests to, which is iulplkticahjbflq.ransommethis.net
